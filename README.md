# Austin Animal Shelter Analysis

I obtained the data through [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes)

## The purpose of this project

With this project, I want to learn about processes such as exploratory data
analysis and data visualizations through R and Shiny App

## Why I'm interested in this dataset?

Being a big animal lover and an advocate for adopting rather than buying pets
I'd like to why people adopt or give away their pets

## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer and communicate about this domain?

1. What variables makes an animal more likely to be adopted? More likely to be
given away?

2. How has adoption trends changed over time?
